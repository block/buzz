/**
 * Delete every managed-agent instance backed by `persona`, applying the same
 * per-agent rules as {@link deleteManagedAgentWithRules} — including the
 * orphan-warning confirm for provider deployments.
 *
 * Callers must run this to completion *before* deleting the persona itself:
 * `delete_persona` refuses to cascade over a provider-deployed instance, so a
 * persona whose instances are still deployed cannot be deleted at all.
 *
 * Contract, shared with `deleteProfileManagedAgentsForPersona` in
 * `features/profile/ui/UserProfilePanelDeletion.ts`: stop the cascade at the
 * first cancelled or failed instance delete, so the persona is not deleted on
 * top of a partial teardown.
 *
 * Aborting stops *further* deletes — it cannot undo the ones that already ran,
 * and instance deletes are not reversible. Instances are visited in
 * `managedAgents` order and only provider-deployed ones prompt, so a local
 * instance ahead of a declined provider instance is already gone by the time
 * the user cancels. `deletedCount` reports how many were destroyed precisely so
 * the caller can tell the user about that partial state instead of silently
 * keeping the persona.
 *
 * The profile variant additionally removes each agent from its channels between
 * deletes, which is why the two loops are kept separate rather than
 * parameterized — keep both in step.
