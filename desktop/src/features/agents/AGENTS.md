# Agent Configuration — Contributor Rules

Scope: `desktop/src/features/agents/` (config surfaces, shared config renderer,
and the agent config core). Read this before changing how harness / provider /
model / effort configuration is modeled, rendered, persisted, or applied.

Plan of record: `Buzz/Harness-Provider-Model.md` in Morgan's Obsidian vault
(PR sequence, decisions log). PRs: #2140 (rename), #2148 (flag reduction),
#2156 (honest model states), #2158 (Agent Config Core).

## The one rule

**Harness capability facts have exactly one source: the Rust runtime catalog.**
`KnownAcpRuntime` (`desktop/src-tauri/src/managed_agents/discovery/runtime_metadata.rs`)
declares each harness's model/provider/effort env keys and capabilities. Spawn
applies them; `AcpRuntimeCatalogEntry` exposes them over IPC; and
`lib/agentConfigCore.ts` projects them into field descriptors. The frontend
never maintains a rival copy of this table. Setup guidance follows the same
rule: `requires_external_cli` is derived from `KnownAcpRuntime` and projected
to the UI rather than inferred from a runtime ID in a component.

If you need a new capability fact (a new env key, a native option, a "supports
X" flag): add it to `KnownAcpRuntime` first, expose it on
`AcpRuntimeCatalogEntry`, then project it through the core. Do not shortcut
with a TypeScript lookup table or an id comparison in a component.

## Rules

1. **No hardcoded harness-ID checks in render code.** `runtime.id === "claude"`
   belongs in `deriveAgentConfigFieldModel` (once, with a named reason), never
   in a component. Components ask the field model what exists
   (`hasRenderableAgentConfigField`, `getRenderableEffortField`).
2. **Effort reads/writes go through the descriptor.** Use the effort
   descriptor's `currentPersistence` key — never a raw
   `BUZZ_AGENT_THINKING_EFFORT` literal in UI code. `currentPersistence` is
   where the value lives *today*; `targetApplication` is how the harness
   *should* receive it. They intentionally differ until PR 2.7 migrates
   Goose/Claude — do not "fix" one to match the other without doing the
   migration work.
3. **Field absence has a named reason, not a boolean.** Codex effort is
   `ownedByModelId`; Claude effort is `deferredUntilNativeOptionsAvailable`.
   New absences get new named reasons in `AgentConfigOmission` /
   `render` — never a `showX` prop.
4. **The clearing policy is the named types.** `onContextChange:
   "resetDependentValues"` (user changed harness/provider → dependent values
   reset everywhere) vs `onCatalogMismatch: "explainOnly" | "onboardingCleanup"`
   (an async catalog miss never silently erases saved state outside
   onboarding's named cleanup). Do not add mutation booleans like
   `clearInvalidModel`; extend the policy types.
5. **"Metadata unknown" ≠ "harness lacks the capability".** Passing
   `runtime: undefined` to the core means fields won't render. Surfaces must
   gate on the runtime catalog query settling (loading/error states) rather
   than letting fields silently vanish — see `AgentDefaultsEditor` /
   `DefaultConfigStep` for the pattern.
6. **One canonical behavior, disclosure presets for visibility.** Behavior
   flags were deliberately killed in #2148 (`CANONICAL_CONFIG_BEHAVIORS`).
   Surface differences are expressed via the `disclosure` preset, not new
   boolean props.  **Exception:** `onboarding-essential` hides happy-path
   helper copy (provider/model descriptions) but a non-null model-discovery
   status always bypasses the preset and renders the status line — enforced
   via `shouldShowModelStatusMessage()` (`AgentConfigFields.tsx`).
   Additionally, a successful discovery response that yields no usable options
   (`supportsSwitching:false` or empty model list) synthesizes a warning status
   via `synthesizeEmptyDiscoveryStatus()` and is intentionally **not cached**
   so that closing → reopening the dialog re-runs discovery after the user
   installs or signs into the CLI (`isCacheableDiscoveryResponse()`).
7. **Onboarding setup detects readiness; it does not select defaults.** The
   setup page derives visible and ready harnesses from the runtime catalog and
   only offers install or sign-in actions. The following defaults page is the
   sole onboarding surface that chooses and persists `preferred_runtime`, and
   its Finish gate consumes the shared renderer's `onValidityChange` signal —
   a harness selection alone does not complete onboarding when the harness
   requires provider/model/credential config (e.g. buzz-agent with no
   provider). Baked build env and runtime-file config satisfy the gate.
   `onboarding-agent-defaults.spec.ts` is the acceptance gate for anything
   touching this flow or the shared renderer.
8. **Omit the Model control only after a confirmed successful empty
   discovery on an optional-model harness.** When the field model marks model
   as `acpNative` (Claude Code / Codex), `shouldRenderModelControl` hides the
   picker while discovery is in flight and after IPC resolves with no usable
   options (`modelDiscoverySuccessfulEmpty` / `isSuccessfulEmptyDiscovery`).
   A thrown or unavailable discovery keeps the control so #2246 failure UI can
   render, and must not heal/clear persisted model or effort. Full disclosure
   still shows the control when Custom model is available. Required-model
   harnesses always keep the field. Gate: `defaults hides model when optional
   harness has empty discovery` (and the failed-discovery counterpart) in
   `onboarding-agent-defaults.spec.ts`.
9. **The defaults modal is progressively disclosed.** An unset global config
   starts on the Buzz Agent-first deployment fallback and carries that visible
   harness into the next saved edit. The `progressive-defaults` disclosure
   preset therefore begins at Provider for Buzz Agent, then reveals Model,
   Effort, and Advanced only after a provider is configured. Harnesses whose
   runtime metadata has no provider field skip that gate. Reveals animate their
   height through Motion and become immediate when reduced motion is requested.
   Once the Advanced toggle is visible, its expanded state is exclusively
   user-controlled: provider, harness, and required-env changes must never
   open it automatically in defaults, create, or edit flows. In Create mode,
   the defaults summary follows preferred-harness changes saved while the
   dialog is open, and its configured state includes required credentials as
   well as provider/model values. If no available harness can resolve, Create
   starts in Customize and lets unavailable catalog entries be selected only
   to expose their setup guidance; submission remains blocked.
   Advanced-only required credentials mark the collapsed Advanced toggle
   without opening it in Global Defaults and Edit, and block incomplete saves.
   Runtime-file credentials satisfy Global Defaults just as they do Create and
   Edit. In Edit,
   selecting Custom command keeps its required command field beside the harness
   picker rather than hiding it in Advanced.
10. **Catalog visibility is community-scoped relay state, never a global
    definition field.** `AgentDefinition.shared` is only the active
    relay+owner projection returned to the UI. Durable heads and pending
    publications live in the scoped retention database, and explicit share
    toggles await relay acceptance before the UI claims that an agent was
    published or removed. A queued update must stay visibly queued, and the
    catalog itself must render only relay-confirmed publications — never an
    optimistic local persona.
11. **Shared agent access names the consequence where it is selected.** The
   shared respond-to field shows a persistent warning whenever `anyone` **or**
   `allowlist` is selected — both hand the host's access to someone other than
   the owner, so both disclose it and only the audience phrase differs. This
   covers persona-backed create and edit surfaces. Keep that disclosure in
   the shared field instead of adding surface-specific flags. It renders
   directly below the selector for `anyone` but *after* the people picker for
   `allowlist`, so it never sits between the user and the selection they came
   to make. The copy leads with the audience ("Anyone can use this agent to
   access…") so it reads as a warning rather than an explanation, and stays one
   sentence — don't split the mechanism into a second sentence. Both the machine
   and the stakes it names come from `lib/agentAccessWarning.ts`, keyed on an
   optional `runLocation`: instance surfaces resolve it from
   `ManagedAgent.backend` via `runLocationForBackend`, and the create flow from
   `WhereToRunDraft.runOn` via `runLocationForRunOn`. `AgentDialog` is the one
   place that resolves it for dialog surfaces and publishes it through
   `ui/AgentRunLocationContext.tsx`; the field reads that context and lets an
   explicit `runLocation` prop win. Do **not** thread the value as a prop
   through `AgentDefinitionDialog` / `AgentInstanceEditDialog` — both are
   already over the 1000-line ceiling, and neither uses the value itself.
   Surfaces rendered outside `AgentDialog` (e.g. `EditRespondToDialog`) pass the
   prop directly. Local names "your
   computer, including files, accounts, and connected tools"; remote names "the
   server it runs on, including any accounts and tools available there" —
   deliberately *not* the owner's files, which aren't theirs to describe on a
   host they don't own. **An unknown location falls back to the local wording —
   never hedge with "computer or server".** A remote host requires an
   installed `buzz-backend-*` provider, and without one `WhereToRunSection`
   never renders, so "server" would name a concept the owner has never been
   shown; when it *is* remote they picked that host from the selector
   themselves. Never synthesize a run location a surface doesn't have. Don't
   expose `respond-to`, `allowlist`, Nostr, or harness jargon in primary UI
   copy.

## The tests that enforce this

- `lib/agentConfigCore.test.mjs` — field model per harness × scope, clearing
  policy. Update when the capability model changes.
- `ui/agentConfigFieldsContract.test.mjs` — canonical behaviors + disclosure
  presets + `shouldShowModelStatusMessage` status-bypass +
  `shouldRenderModelControl` (successful-empty omit vs failure keep). If this
  fails, you probably reintroduced a per-surface flag or conflated empty with
  failed discovery.
- `ui/usePersonaModelDiscovery.test.mjs` — `synthesizeEmptyDiscoveryStatus`,
  `isCacheableDiscoveryResponse`, `deriveModelDiscoveryPending`,
  `isSuccessfulEmptyDiscovery`. If the "reopen to retry" copy becomes inert
  again, these tests will catch it.
- `ui/respondToFieldContract.test.mjs` — plain-language mode labels, the
  persistent warning contract for shared agent access, and its two render
  positions (after the people picker for `allowlist`).
- `lib/agentAccessWarning.test.mjs` — every mode × run-location copy variant
  plus both resolvers, including unknown-reads-as-local and
  blank-`runOn`-is-not-a-provider.
- `desktop/tests/e2e/onboarding-agent-defaults.spec.ts` — onboarding behavior
  acceptance coverage for readiness, failure states, defaults, navigation,
  successful-empty vs failed optional-model discovery, and persistence races.
- Rust: `runtime_metadata_env_vars` tests pin spawn-time key application.
- Rust: persona sharing/retention tests pin relay+owner scoping, durable
  enqueue errors, relay rejection/unavailability, and accepted publication.

## Keep this file true

**If you change how agent configuration is modeled, rendered, persisted,
applied, or cleared — update this file in the same PR.** A rule that no longer
matches the code is worse than no rule; a new pattern that isn't written down
here will be broken by the next agent that never learns it existed. Reviewers:
treat a config-behavior diff without a matching AGENTS.md diff (or an explicit
"no rules changed" note) as incomplete.
