# Agent Configuration — Contributor Rules

Scope: `desktop/src/features/agents/` (config surfaces, shared config renderer,
and the agent config core). Read this before changing how harness / provider /
model / effort configuration is modeled, rendered, persisted, or applied.

Plan of record: `Buzz/Harness-Provider-Model.md` in Morgan's Obsidian vault
(PR sequence, decisions log). PRs: #2140 (rename), #2148 (flag reduction),
#2156 (honest model states), #2158 (Agent Config Core).

## The one rule

**Harness capability facts have exactly one source: the Rust runtime catalog.**
`KnownAcpRuntime` (`desktop/src-tauri/src/managed_agents/discovery/runtime_metadata.rs`)
declares each harness's model/provider/effort env keys and capabilities. Spawn
applies them; `AcpRuntimeCatalogEntry` exposes them over IPC; and
`lib/agentConfigCore.ts` projects them into field descriptors. The frontend
never maintains a rival copy of this table.

If you need a new capability fact (a new env key, a native option, a "supports
X" flag): add it to `KnownAcpRuntime` first, expose it on
`AcpRuntimeCatalogEntry`, then project it through the core. Do not shortcut
with a TypeScript lookup table or an id comparison in a component.

## Rules

1. **No hardcoded harness-ID checks in render code.** `runtime.id === "claude"`
   belongs in `deriveAgentConfigFieldModel` (once, with a named reason), never
   in a component. Components ask the field model what exists
   (`hasRenderableAgentConfigField`, `getRenderableEffortField`).
2. **Effort reads/writes go through the descriptor.** Use the effort
   descriptor's `currentPersistence` key — never a raw
   `BUZZ_AGENT_THINKING_EFFORT` literal in UI code. `currentPersistence` is
   where the value lives *today*; `targetApplication` is how the harness
   *should* receive it. They intentionally differ until PR 2.7 migrates
   Goose/Claude — do not "fix" one to match the other without doing the
   migration work.
3. **Field absence has a named reason, not a boolean.** Codex effort is
   `ownedByModelId`; Claude effort is `deferredUntilNativeOptionsAvailable`.
   New absences get new named reasons in `AgentConfigOmission` /
   `render` — never a `showX` prop.
4. **The clearing policy is the named types.** `onContextChange:
   "resetDependentValues"` (user changed harness/provider → dependent values
   reset everywhere) vs `onCatalogMismatch: "explainOnly" | "onboardingCleanup"`
   (an async catalog miss never silently erases saved state outside
   onboarding's named cleanup). Do not add mutation booleans like
   `clearInvalidModel`; extend the policy types.
5. **"Metadata unknown" ≠ "harness lacks the capability".** Passing
   `runtime: undefined` to the core means fields won't render. Surfaces must
   gate on the runtime catalog query settling (loading/error states) rather
   than letting fields silently vanish — see `AgentDefaultsEditor` /
   `DefaultConfigStep` for the pattern.
6. **One canonical behavior, disclosure presets for visibility.** Behavior
   flags were deliberately killed in #2148 (`CANONICAL_CONFIG_BEHAVIORS`).
   Surface differences are expressed via the `disclosure` preset, not new
   boolean props.  **Exception:** `onboarding-essential` hides happy-path
   helper copy (provider/model descriptions) but a non-null model-discovery
   status always bypasses the preset and renders the status line — enforced
   via `shouldShowModelStatusMessage()` (`AgentConfigFields.tsx`).
   Additionally, a successful discovery response that yields no usable options
   (`supportsSwitching:false` or empty model list) synthesizes a warning status
   via `synthesizeEmptyDiscoveryStatus()` and is intentionally **not cached**
   so that closing → reopening the dialog re-runs discovery after the user
   installs or signs into the CLI (`isCacheableDiscoveryResponse()`).
7. **Onboarding setup detects readiness; it does not select defaults.** The
   setup page derives visible and ready harnesses from the runtime catalog and
   only offers install or sign-in actions. The following defaults page is the
   sole onboarding surface that chooses and persists `preferred_runtime`.
   `onboarding-agent-defaults.spec.ts` is the acceptance gate for anything
   touching this flow or the shared renderer.
8. **Omit the Model control only after a confirmed successful empty
   discovery on an optional-model harness.** When the field model marks model
   as `acpNative` (Claude Code / Codex), `shouldRenderModelControl` hides the
   picker while discovery is in flight and after IPC resolves with no usable
   options (`modelDiscoverySuccessfulEmpty` / `isSuccessfulEmptyDiscovery`).
   A thrown or unavailable discovery keeps the control so #2246 failure UI can
   render, and must not heal/clear persisted model or effort. Full disclosure
   still shows the control when Custom model is available. Required-model
   harnesses always keep the field. Gate: `defaults hides model when optional
   harness has empty discovery` (and the failed-discovery counterpart) in
   `onboarding-agent-defaults.spec.ts`.
9. **Runtime enablement is a device-local menu preference, not a capability or
   lifecycle fact.** Settings persists disabled runtime IDs through
   `lib/runtimeVisibilityPreference.ts`; harness dropdowns filter those IDs
   from new choices while the raw Rust catalog remains authoritative for
   installation, capabilities, and existing agent configuration. Turning a
   runtime off must not uninstall it, stop it, or invalidate an existing
   agent that already uses it. If the disabled runtime was the saved global
   default, consumers immediately ignore that preference and the defaults
   editor persists its visible fallback on the next save. Its dependent
   provider/model defaults are also ignored for new implicit fallback agents,
   without changing the persisted configuration used by existing agents.
   `resolvePersonaRuntime` is the shared visibility boundary for every
   runtime-less deployment or provisioning path. Definition-to-instance starts
   use the stricter `resolveStartRuntimeForDefinition` wrapper; call one of
   these shared resolvers instead of duplicating default selection in a start
   surface. Team deploys use the same visible-runtime set only for members that
   need an implicit fallback, so a fully pinned team remains deployable even
   when every installed runtime is hidden. Definitions already pinned to a
   hidden runtime remain runnable.

## The tests that enforce this

- `lib/agentConfigCore.test.mjs` — field model per harness × scope, clearing
  policy. Update when the capability model changes.
- `ui/agentConfigFieldsContract.test.mjs` — canonical behaviors + disclosure
  presets + `shouldShowModelStatusMessage` status-bypass +
  `shouldRenderModelControl` (successful-empty omit vs failure keep). If this
  fails, you probably reintroduced a per-surface flag or conflated empty with
  failed discovery.
- `ui/usePersonaModelDiscovery.test.mjs` — `synthesizeEmptyDiscoveryStatus`,
  `isCacheableDiscoveryResponse`, `deriveModelDiscoveryPending`,
  `isSuccessfulEmptyDiscovery`. If the "reopen to retry" copy becomes inert
  again, these tests will catch it.
- `desktop/tests/e2e/onboarding-agent-defaults.spec.ts` — onboarding behavior
  acceptance coverage for readiness, failure states, defaults, navigation,
  successful-empty vs failed optional-model discovery, and persistence races.
- Rust: `runtime_metadata_env_vars` tests pin spawn-time key application.

## Keep this file true

**If you change how agent configuration is modeled, rendered, persisted,
applied, or cleared — update this file in the same PR.** A rule that no longer
matches the code is worse than no rule; a new pattern that isn't written down
here will be broken by the next agent that never learns it existed. Reviewers:
treat a config-behavior diff without a matching AGENTS.md diff (or an explicit
"no rules changed" note) as incomplete.
