# Agent Configuration — Contributor Rules

Scope: `desktop/src/features/agents/` (config surfaces, shared config renderer,
and the agent config core). Read this before changing how harness / provider /
model / effort configuration is modeled, rendered, persisted, or applied.

Plan of record: `Buzz/Harness-Provider-Model.md` in Morgan's Obsidian vault
(PR sequence, decisions log). PRs: #2140 (rename), #2148 (flag reduction),
#2156 (honest model states), #2158 (Agent Config Core).

## The one rule

**Harness capability facts have exactly one source: the Rust runtime catalog.**
`KnownAcpRuntime` (`desktop/src-tauri/src/managed_agents/discovery/runtime_metadata.rs`)
declares each harness's model/provider/effort env keys and capabilities. Spawn
applies them; `AcpRuntimeCatalogEntry` exposes them over IPC; and
`lib/agentConfigCore.ts` projects them into field descriptors. The frontend
never maintains a rival copy of this table.

If you need a new capability fact (a new env key, a native option, a "supports
X" flag): add it to `KnownAcpRuntime` first, expose it on
`AcpRuntimeCatalogEntry`, then project it through the core. Do not shortcut
with a TypeScript lookup table or an id comparison in a component.

## Rules

1. **No hardcoded harness-ID checks in render code.** `runtime.id === "claude"`
   belongs in `deriveAgentConfigFieldModel` (once, with a named reason), never
   in a component. Components ask the field model what exists
   (`hasRenderableAgentConfigField`, `getRenderableEffortField`).
2. **Effort reads/writes go through the descriptor.** Use the effort
   descriptor's `currentPersistence` key — never a raw
   `BUZZ_AGENT_THINKING_EFFORT` literal in UI code. `currentPersistence` is
   where the value lives *today*; `targetApplication` is how the harness
   *should* receive it. They intentionally differ until PR 2.7 migrates
   Goose/Claude — do not "fix" one to match the other without doing the
   migration work.
3. **Field absence has a named reason, not a boolean.** Codex effort is
   `ownedByModelId`; Claude effort is `deferredUntilNativeOptionsAvailable`.
   New absences get new named reasons in `AgentConfigOmission` /
   `render` — never a `showX` prop.
4. **The clearing policy is the named types.** `onContextChange:
   "resetDependentValues"` (user changed harness/provider → dependent values
   reset everywhere) vs `onCatalogMismatch: "explainOnly" | "onboardingCleanup"`
   (an async catalog miss never silently erases saved state outside
   onboarding's named cleanup). Do not add mutation booleans like
   `clearInvalidModel`; extend the policy types.
5. **"Metadata unknown" ≠ "harness lacks the capability".** Passing
   `runtime: undefined` to the core means fields won't render. Surfaces must
   gate on the runtime catalog query settling (loading/error states) rather
   than letting fields silently vanish — see `AgentDefaultsEditor` /
   `DefaultConfigStep` for the pattern.
6. **One canonical behavior, disclosure presets for visibility.** Behavior
   flags were deliberately killed in #2148 (`CANONICAL_CONFIG_BEHAVIORS`).
   Surface differences are expressed via the `disclosure` preset, not new
   boolean props.
7. **Onboarding does not change.** `onboarding-agent-defaults.spec.ts` is the
   acceptance gate for anything touching the shared renderer.

## The tests that enforce this

- `lib/agentConfigCore.test.mjs` — field model per harness × scope, clearing
  policy. Update when the capability model changes.
- `ui/agentConfigFieldsContract.test.mjs` — canonical behaviors + disclosure
  presets. If this fails, you probably reintroduced a per-surface flag.
- `desktop/tests/e2e/onboarding-agent-defaults.spec.ts` — onboarding behavior
  pin (35 tests).
- Rust: `runtime_metadata_env_vars` tests pin spawn-time key application.

## Keep this file true

**If you change how agent configuration is modeled, rendered, persisted,
applied, or cleared — update this file in the same PR.** A rule that no longer
matches the code is worse than no rule; a new pattern that isn't written down
here will be broken by the next agent that never learns it existed. Reviewers:
treat a config-behavior diff without a matching AGENTS.md diff (or an explicit
"no rules changed" note) as incomplete.
