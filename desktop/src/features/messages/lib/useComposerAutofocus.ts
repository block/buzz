/**
 * Focus the composer editor on mount and whenever the active draft key
 * changes (channel switch, thread open).
 *
 * Matches the behaviour of Slack/Discord/Signal: the composer is ready to
 * accept typing without an explicit click. Editor identity recovers from the
 * editor-not-ready-yet case on first render.
 *
 * The effect trigger deliberately excludes `disabled`: callers pass a
 * disabled flag that includes transient state like `isSending`, which would
 * otherwise re-fire autofocus after every send. When the main channel and
 * an open thread panel both have composers mounted, that race let the main
 * composer steal focus from the thread composer post-send. We only autofocus
 * on mount and on real navigation events (draft-key change).
 *
 * Guards:
 *  - Skip if the composer is currently disabled (archived channel, no
 *    channel, or in-flight send at the moment of mount).
 *  - Skip if focus already lives in another text-entry surface (open
 *    dialog input, search box, etc.) so we don't yank focus from the user.
