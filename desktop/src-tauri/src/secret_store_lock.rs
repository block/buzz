//! Interprocess advisory lock for the [`super::SecretStore`] blob.
//!
//! Two concurrent Buzz processes (e.g. the signed DMG build and an unsigned dev
//! build via `just staging`) share the same OS keychain blob because the
//! service name `"buzz-desktop"` is a constant — it does not key off the bundle
//! identifier. Each process holds its own in-memory cache, so without an
//! interprocess lock a warm-cache write in process A drops keys added by process
//! B between A's last cache-warming read and A's write.
//!
//! The fix: `mutate_blob` acquires an exclusive advisory file lock, then always
//! performs a fresh `read_blob_raw()` inside the lock, applies the mutation,
//! writes back, and releases. The cache is still updated after a successful
//! write, so same-process reads remain fast. The lock is file-based at a fixed
//! per-user path `/tmp/buzz-keychain-<uid>-<service>.lock` on Unix — a path
//! that is invariant to `$TMPDIR`/process environment, so both the GUI-launched
//! signed DMG and a terminal-launched dev build always take the same lock.
