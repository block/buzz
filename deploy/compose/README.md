# Buzz Docker Compose deployment

This is the single-node/VPS deployment bundle. It is intentionally separate from
the root `docker-compose.yml`, which remains local development infrastructure.

## Quick start

```bash
cd deploy/compose
cp .env.example .env
$EDITOR .env       # replace every CHANGE_ME value
./run.sh start
```

For a public VPS with automatic Let's Encrypt certificates:

```bash
cd deploy/compose
BUZZ_COMPOSE_TLS=true ./run.sh start
```

The bootstrap script should eventually replace manual `.env` editing for normal
users. It is responsible for generating stable secrets and, optionally, an owner
keypair.

## Production notes

- Requires Docker Compose v2.24.4 or newer; the TLS override uses Compose's
  `!reset` tag to remove the direct relay port when Caddy terminates HTTPS.
- Default `BUZZ_IMAGE` tracks `ghcr.io/block/buzz:main` for early testing. Pin it to `ghcr.io/block/buzz:sha-<7>` or a semver release tag for production once available.
- Keep `BUZZ_RELAY_PRIVATE_KEY`, `BUZZ_GIT_HOOK_HMAC_SECRET`, database/Redis,
  and S3 secrets stable across restarts.
- `RELAY_OWNER_PUBKEY` is intentionally not prefixed with `BUZZ_`; it must be a
  64-character hex Nostr pubkey when closed relay mode is enabled.
- `BUZZ_AUTO_MIGRATE` is opt-in. Set `BUZZ_AUTO_MIGRATE=true` or run
  `buzz-admin migrate` before starting the relay when bootstrapping a fresh
  database. Auto-migration requires an image that includes embedded SQLx
  migrations.
- The stack uses Postgres, Redis, MinIO, and a git data volume because
  those are real Buzz dependencies today. Minimal mode can simplify this later.
- The bundled Compose stack fixes the relay endpoint to `http://minio:9000` and
  `BUZZ_S3_ADDRESSING_STYLE=path`: Docker DNS resolves `minio`, not
  `<bucket>.minio`. It is not configurable for an external S3 provider through
  `.env`; use the Helm chart or a custom Compose configuration for providers
  such as new Railway Storage Buckets that require `virtual` addressing.

Run `./run.sh backup-hint` for the backup checklist.

## Backup and recovery

Back up `.env`, PostgreSQL, and the complete configured MinIO/S3 bucket from
the same maintenance window. Stop the stack while taking the data snapshots
when possible. If the storage provider only supports ordered live snapshots,
capture PostgreSQL before the object store. The object store is the durable
source of truth for Git packs, manifests, and manifest pointers as well as
media. Redis contains disposable coordination and presence state and can be
recreated empty after a restore.

The `buzz-git-data` volume holds only scratch data and a process-local pack
cache. Its cache contents are not reused after a relay restart, and the volume
is not a repository backup.

A recovery test must restore the coordinated data into an isolated stack and
perform an authenticated clone. Compare the recovered branch and tag refs,
commits, and trees with values recorded before the backup. Container health,
database row counts, object counts, or a restored `buzz-git-data` volume do not
prove that a repository can be read. See
[`docs/git-on-object-storage.md`](../../docs/git-on-object-storage.md) for the
storage model.

## Validation

Before sharing an install link publicly, verify a fresh install with:

```bash
cd deploy/compose
cp .env.example .env
$EDITOR .env
./run.sh config
./run.sh start
curl -fsS "http://127.0.0.1:$(grep -E '^BUZZ_HTTP_PORT=' .env | cut -d= -f2-)/_liveness"
./run.sh status
```
