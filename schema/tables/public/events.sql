-- ── Events (partitioned by month on created_at) ──────────────────────────────
-- Conformance: "Channel-less global events and DMs". `community_id` leads the
-- PK and every hot-path index. Partition stays BY RANGE (created_at) — the
-- monthly partition manager is unchanged (Max's call, plan §5/Lane0 contract).
-- Cross-community dedup: same signed event may exist in two communities;
-- (community_id, created_at, id) dedupes within one, allows across.
