-- ── Scheduled workflow fires (cron claim) ─────────────────────────────────────
-- Plan §5: the at-most-once cron fire claim. UNIQUE (community_id, workflow_id,
-- scheduled_for) — only the pod that wins the claim insert creates the run.
-- Restart-safe (DB-durable). community is server provenance: the scheduler passes
-- workflow.community_id from list_all_enabled_workflows(), never a client input.
-- workflow_id is NOT globally unique under the (community_id, id) workflow key, so
-- the claim binds both community and id explicitly rather than resolving from id.
-- workflow_run_id links the won claim to the run it created (audit; NULL until the
-- post-insert attach, and stays NULL if run creation failed after a won claim).
-- The FK to workflow_runs uses NO ACTION (not SET NULL): community_id is shared
-- with the claim PK and is NOT NULL, so SET NULL is unimplementable here; a future
-- delete of a still-linked run is blocked rather than orphaning the at-most-once
-- claim row. workflow_runs are not pruned today, so this is a guardrail, not a path.
