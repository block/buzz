//! Community moderation command handler (kinds 9040–9044, Phase 1 contract).
//!
//! Mirrors the NIP-43 relay-admin pattern (`relay_admin.rs`, 9030-series):
//! commands are validated + executed directly and are **never** stored as
//! regular events. Authorization goes through
//! [`crate::handlers::moderation_authz::authorize_moderation_action`] —
//! never inline role checks.
//!
//! | Kind | Operation      | Side effects (all mandatory)                       |
//! |------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
//! | 9040 | Ban            | `community_bans` upsert, audit row, live disconnect (L4 fanout), restriction notice DM (L5) |
//! | 9041 | Unban          | ban lift, audit row                                |
//! | 9042 | Timeout        | `muted_until` upsert, audit row, notice DM         |
//! | 9043 | Untimeout      | mute clear, audit row                              |
//! | 9044 | Resolve report | report status update, audit row, reporter notice DM; `delete`/`kick`/`ban` resolutions fan out through the existing 9005/9001 + 9040 paths |
//!
//! Targets (`p` tag pubkey, `report` tag row id) are resolved under the
//! request's `TenantContext` only.
//!
//! ## Routing (pinned — Wren contract review, 2026-07-07)
//! 9040–9044 are **community-global direct commands**, exactly like the
//! relay-admin 9030-series: route via
//! [`buzz_core::kind::is_moderation_command_kind`], list them in
//! `is_global_only_kind` so a stray `h` tag can never channel-scope them
//! (no channel membership/archive gates apply), require a fresh timestamp,
//! never store them, and reject channel-scoped API tokens.
//!
//! ## Tag vocabulary (pinned — CLI and relay must agree)
//! - 9040 ban: `["p", <hex pubkey>]` required; optional
//!   `["expiration", <unix secs>]` (absent ⇒ permanent), `["reason", <text>]`.
//! - 9041 unban: `["p", <hex pubkey>]`.
//! - 9042 timeout: `["p", <hex pubkey>]` + required `["expiration", <unix secs>]`;
//!   optional `["reason", <text>]`.
//! - 9043 untimeout: `["p", <hex pubkey>]`.
//! - 9044 resolve (pinned — thread event `86f46207`, 2026-07-07): required,
//!   exactly one each: `["report", <report event id hex>]` (the 1984 report
//!   being resolved; resolves under `tenant.community()` only),
//!   `["status", resolved|dismissed]`,
//!   `["action", delete|kick|ban|timeout|dismiss|escalate]` (`dismiss` pairs
//!   with status `dismissed`; everything else with `resolved`). Optional
//!   `["reason", <text>]` — audited into `moderation_actions.public_reason`
//!   and relayed in the notice DM (so it must be safe for the reporter's
//!   eyes; `private_reason` is mod-only and not fed by 9044 tags). Unknown
//!   extra tags are ignored, not rejected
//!   (forward-compat). `delete`/`kick`/`ban`/`timeout` actions fan out through
//!   the existing 9005/9001 paths and the 9040/9042 handlers — no second
//!   implementation.
//!
//! Lane ownership: L6 (Quinn) — plus `buzz-cli` `moderation` command group.
//! The `ingest.rs` routing entries (scope map + `is_global_only_kind` +
//! direct-processing dispatch) for 9040–9044 belong to L3 (Perci):
//! coordinate, don't edit ingest.rs.
